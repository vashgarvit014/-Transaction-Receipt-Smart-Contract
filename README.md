# ðŸ’° Transaction Receipt Smart Contract  

## ðŸ“œ Description  
The **Transaction Receipt Smart Contract** is a blockchain-based system that **automatically issues receipts** for transactions. Each receipt logs the **senderâ€™s address, receiverâ€™s address, transaction amount, and timestamp**, ensuring **transparency, immutability, and verifiability** on-chain.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Automated Receipt Generation** for every transaction.  
- **Immutable Records** ensuring tamper-proof transaction logs.  
- **Event Emission** for real-time tracking and external monitoring.  
- **Easy Retrieval** of receipts with transaction details.  
- **No Deployment Inputs Required**, making it simple to use.
